# Building-a-dev-environment-with-Terraform
Development environment with Terraform HCL configuration script on aws.

## NB: Nice to Know
* vscode is the admin name used here.
* Create a user and assign security permissions in aws IAM. Programmatic access and Administrator rights would be fine.
* Create a keypair for whatever region you choose.
* Edit the HCL script under aws ec2 instance and attach your keypair names where applicable.
